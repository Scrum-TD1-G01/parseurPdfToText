	  ABSTRACT Community discovery (i.e. community detection) in signed networks is a division of nodes,
	  such that the edges in the communities are positive and the edges between the communities are negative.
	  Davis and Harary have solved the problem of community detection when a signed graph is balanced or
	  weakly balanced. When the signed network is unbalanced, community detection becomes very complex. In
	  this paper, we propose a novel memetic algorithm (MA) called MACD-SN for community partition (i.e.
	  community detection) in signed networks. Firstly, we present a novel initialization algorithm used in
	  initialization of MACD-SN. This method can accelerate the convergence rate of MACD-SN algorithm.
	  Next, in addition to using frequently-used variation operation (in this paper, variation and mutation are
	  interchangeable), this paper presents a novel crossover operation and a novel variation operation, which
	  contributes to increasing the correctness of the MACD-SN algorithm's operation result and reduces its
	  running time. Lastly, this paper proposes a new local search algorithm, which may enable the algorithm's
	  result to jump away the local best result with a certain probability and draw near the global best result
	  quickly. For testing the performance of MACD-SN algorithm, we have done many experiments using five
	  kinds of synthetic signed networks and five real-world signed networks. The test outcomes show that the
	  proposed algorithm is valid and efficient for signed network cluster partition (i.e. community detection).

	  I. INTRODUCTION
	  Modern network science is an active field in understanding
	  complex systems. Actually, a lot of complicated systems in
	  various fields can be expressed by means of networks, for
	  example, complex collaborative relationships [1], social
	  systems [2], information systems [3], etc. In these networks,
	  nodes (or vertices) represent individual participants, and
	  edges (or links) represent relationships between participants.
	  A great deal of research efforts have been done on complex
	  networks, such as correlation clustering, dynamic network
	  evolution. Generally speaking, identifying community
	  partition is an important task in complex network analysis.
	  Community structures exist in a lot of network systems,
	  such as politics, economics, engineering, computer science,
	  biology and so on. A comment on network community
	  discovery can be found in Ref. [4]. The purpose of
	  community discovery is to identify clusters with dense links
	  within clusters and only sparse links between clusters [5].
	  In theoretical research and practical activities, community
	  discovery is of great significance. For instance, in the
	  purchasing relations network between customers and online
	  retailers’ products (such as www.taobao.com), identifying
	  clusters of customers with similar interests can establish an
	  effective recommendation system [4, 6].
	  In human society, many relationships between people are
	  signed, either positive or negative. Compared with traditional
	  networks, the positive and negative edges of signed networks
	  can more accurately describe cooperation (friendship/trust)
	  relations and competition (hostility/distrust) relations. When
	  two people have a relationship of trust, respect or love, the
	  relationship can be regarded as a positive connection. But,
	  the relationship with mistrust, disrespect or hatred can be
	  considered as a negative connection. This network is called
	  signed network [7], that is, the edge weight is greater than 0,
	  indicating a positive relationship; the edge weight is less than
	  0, indicating a negative relationship; and the edge weight is
	  equal to 0, indicating that there is no relationship between
	  these two individuals. Figure 1 shows a simple signed
	  network. In the figure, the solid line edge represents a
	  positive relationship, and the dotted line edge represents a

	  negative relationship. Community discovery in signed
	  networks is quite different from that in unsigned networks
	  (that is, networks only contain positive connections). In
	  unsigned networks, the community structure is defined as a
	  group of nodes or vertices which have dense connections
	  within groups and sparse connections between groups.
	  Whereas for signed social networks, communities (i.e.
	  clusters) are defined not only by the density of connections
	  but also by the signs of connections. The connections should
	  be densely positive and sparsely negative in a community
	  while densely negative and sparsely positive between
	  communities. Many negative connections exist in the
	  communities and many positive connections exist between
	  the communities make community detection more difficult.
	  A strongly (or weakly) balanced signed network can be
	  divided into two (or more) clusters, so that all connections
	  within clusters are positive, and all connections between
	  clusters are negative [8-10]. However, due to the existence of
	  negative connections in clusters and positive connections
	  between clusters, the real world signed networks are often
	  unbalanced. Therefore, it is a great challenge to design an
	  effective and efficient algorithm to discover the community
	  structure in signed graphs.
	  FIGURE 1. A schematic diagram of a simple signed graph.
	  Unlike previous work, this paper proposes a new memetic
	  algorithm to detect community structure in signed networks.
	  In order to accelerate the convergence of algorithm (decrease
	  the numbers of loop), a novel population initialization
	  method of memetic algorithm is presented. Besides
	  employing the frequently-used variation operation, a novel
	  crossover operation (called randomized two-way crossover
	  operation in this article) and a novel variation operation
	  (called community variation operation in this article) are also
	  proposed, which are capable of enhancing the accuracy of the
	  result of the algorithm and speeding up the convergence
	  speed of population. Randomized two-way crossover
	  operation can preferable retain the hereditary properties of
	  previous generation individuals, and community variation
	  operation is capable of enhancing greatly the chromosomes
	  set (i.e. chromosomes population) multiformity of MACD-
	  SN algorithm. Furthermore, this paper also presents a local
	  solution space search subroutine to drive the optimal result of
	  the offspring individuals of the MACD-SN method approach
	  the global optimal result more quickly in the search region.
	  This subroutine is capable of driving the MACD-SN jump
	  away local best solution and attain global best solution with a
	  specified odds. Many experimental results show that the
	  proposed algorithm is effective and efficient for signed
	  network community partition.
	  The remaining sections of this thesis are arranged as
	  follows: The work related to this study is illuminated in
	  Section II. A few key concepts and background knowledge
	  connected with this study are introduced in Section III.
	  Section IV describes presented MACD-SN algorithm for
	  community identification (i.e. community detection) in the
	  signed network in detail. This section introduces the
	  proposed MACD-SN algorithm's chromosome coding
	  method, initialization algorithm of chromosomes set,
	  computational formula of fitness used, tournament selection
	  operator for chromosomes selection, crossover operator and
	  mutation operators of genetic operation, local search function,
	  etc. Section V shows the test results on synthetic and real
	  signed networks. Section VI summarizes the whole paper.

	  In recent decades, due to the emergence of a large number
	  of community partition problems, scholars have proposed
	  many algorithms to settle the community partition problems.

	  called GN algorithm. In addition, Newman also put forward
	  a method called FN based on GN algorithm, which uses

	  represent positive and negative edges, respectively. Six
	  clusters of vertices are divided by solid lines with a green
	  color. According to the order from top left to bottom right
	  on the main diagonal, the number of vertices in each cluster
	  is 1741, 54398, 5922, 6413, 2746 and 1879, severally. In
	  Figure 19, we may observe that the largest cluster with
	  54398 vertices is loose, and the rest of clusters are dense.
	  Among the six clusters, the clusters with 6413 vertices and
	  1879 vertices include a large number of negative edges,
	  while the clusters with 1741 vertices, 5922 vertices and
	  2746 vertices include a large number of positive edges.

	  VI. CONCLUSIONS
	  In the research field of signed graphs, cluster structure is an
	  important network feature. For the sake of better study and
	  take advantage of the signed networks, it is crucial to
	  discover their cluster partition. In this paper, we propose a
	  memetic method named MACD-SN for cluster partitions in
	  signed networks. The individual coding method of MACD-
	  SN algorithm adopts the well-known string-based coding
	  method. In order to speed up the convergence, we proposed
	  a new initialization algorithm for the cluster partitions of
	  signed networks. The fitness function of MACD-SN
	  algorithm uses the function presented in [35]. In order to
	  select parent individuals for succedent genetic operations,
	  we adopt a well-known operator (i.e. tournament selection
	  operator), which provides chromosomes in the parent
	  population identical probabilities to be chosen for
	  subsequent genetic operators. In addition to the frequently-
	  used mutation operation, this paper also presents a novel
	  crossover operation and a novel mutation operation. The
	  novel randomized two-way crossover operation can
	  preferable retain the hereditary properties of the previous
	  generation individuals, and the novel community mutation
	  operator may greatly enhance the population diversity.
	  Moreover, this paper presents a novel local search
	  subroutine, which may enhance the accuracy of the ultimate
	  output of the MACD-SN and reduce its running time, and
	  enable the algorithm to jump out of the local best solution
	  with a specified odds and attain the global best solution. For
	  verifying the detection ability of the proposed algorithm, a
	  large number of tests have been executed on five kinds of
	  synthetic signed graphs and five real signed graphs. Next,
	  we compare the test outcomes with four well-known signed
	  network cluster partition methods. The comparison
	  outcomes show that the performance of MACD-SN method
	  is better than the other four methods, which indicates that
	  the method proposed in this paper is an excellent method to
	  identify cluster partitions in signed networks. The
	  disadvantage of MACD-SN algorithm is that it can't detect
	  overlapping communities in signed networks. We will solve
	  this problem in our future work.
