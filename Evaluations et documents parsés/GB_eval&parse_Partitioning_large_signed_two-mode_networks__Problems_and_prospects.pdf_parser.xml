		While a substantial amount of attention within social network analysis (SNA) has been given to the study
		of one-mode networks, there is an increasing consideration of two-mode networks.

		Although our primary purpose is methodological, we take the ﬁrst step towards bridging Heider’s structural balance theory with recent theorizing in
		international relations on soft balancing of power processes.

	<introduction>
		While a substantial amount of attention within social network
		analysis (SNA) has been given to the study of one-mode networks,
		there is an increasing consideration of two-mode networks.
		[...]
		We conclude with recommendations for further methodological development of blockmodeling approaches to signed data.
	</introduction>
	<corps>
		We couple relaxed structural balance to balance of power ideas
		to provide a substantive foundation for the partitioning methods
		we consider here.
		[...]
		Certainly, the literature on community detection could be very useful. We return to this in our ﬁnal section.
	</corps>
	<discussion>
		During the analyses that led to the results shown here, a num- ber of difﬁcult issues emerged.
		[...]
		Soft balancing implies
		alliances with consistency with regard to joint voting behavior and,
		to capture this, the signed blockmodeling of two-mode data has
		been operationalized in a speciﬁc and substantive driven way.
	</discussion>
	<conclusion>
		We have presented results stemming from the partitioning of signed two-mode data in the form of states voting on military res- olutions that came before the UNGA for two time periods (1981–85 and 1996–2001).
		[...]
		For example, the complete information analysis provides the information needed to determine whether voting differences are due to a particular conﬂict (differences in how to resolve the ongoing Middle East conﬂict for example); or reﬂect more general challenges to a state or an alliances’ military power by constraining its use, e.g., through promotion of norms that prohibit the posses- sion or use of particular weaponry.
